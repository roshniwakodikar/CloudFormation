ðŸš€ Simplifying AWS Cloud Deployments with Nested Stacks!
Sharing some insights into how AWS CloudFormation nested stacks have transformed our infrastructure management, making deployments more modular, scalable, and easier to maintain.

What are Nested Stacks?
Nested stacks in AWS CloudFormation allow you to manage complex infrastructures by breaking them into smaller, reusable components. Think of nested stacks as templates within templates. This hierarchical approach not only simplifies management but also promotes reusability and consistency across different environments.

Introducing â€˜AWS::CloudFormation::Stackâ€™
The â€˜AWS::CloudFormation::Stackâ€™ resource is the key to implementing nested stacks. It enables you to create and manage a CloudFormation stack as a resource within another stack. This allows for modular and hierarchical design of your infrastructure, where each nested stack can be independently updated and maintained.
Why Use Nested Stacks?
  â€¢	Modularity: By dividing infrastructure into smaller stacks, each representing a distinct component (e.g., networking, compute, storage), updates and maintenance become straightforward.
  â€¢	Reusability: Common components can be reused across multiple stacks, reducing redundancy and ensuring consistency.
  â€¢	Scalability: Nested stacks facilitate scaling by allowing you to independently manage different parts of your infrastructure.

Steps to Create Stacks:
1. Upload the Child Template to S3:
  â€¢	Save the `security-group-template.yaml` file.
  â€¢	Upload this file to an S3 bucket. For example, to `s3://my-bucket-name/security-group-template.yaml`. (This URL is being used in TemplateURL of ec2-template.yaml)

2. Deploy the Parent Stack:
  â€¢	Save the `ec2-template.yaml` file.
  â€¢	And deploy the CloudFormation stack.


Key Benefits:
  â€¢	Simplified Updates: Modify the security group in one place (child stack), and changes propagate to all dependent resources.
  â€¢	Improved Organization: Clear separation of concerns between different parts of the infrastructure.
  â€¢	Enhanced Collaboration: Teams can work on different components simultaneously without conflicts.
Conclusion:
Using CloudFormation nested stacks and the â€˜AWS::CloudFormation::Stackâ€™ resource has significantly improved our deployment process by making it more organized, reusable, and scalable.
